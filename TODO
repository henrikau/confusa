SMSAuth: update internal to use only person, and not local copies of attribs

- SLCSKey, cert2str not to include the cert, only the text (as -noout in openssl)

mysql:
- table for incoming CSRs with field:
  * CSR
  * approved (yes/no)
  * time for approval

shell-hacks:
- get the ca_sign to function from php..

signing certificates
- log all certificate-requests (!)
- verify all received certificates (compare signed CSR with CSR in database. validate signature,
  and check CA's public key).

- update slcsweb_auth to figure out correct country for user
- update slcs_person to contain country as an element.

- get script to detect errors from Confusa. Define error-codes and OK-code.
- get script to genereate auth-url and make key_handler aware of this.
