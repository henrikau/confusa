SMSAuth: update internal to use only person, and not local copies of attribs

- SLCSKey, cert2str not to include the cert, only the text (as -noout in openssl)

mysql:
- table for incoming CSRs with field:
  * CSR
  * approved (yes/no)
  * time for approval

- table for signed cert awaiting retrieval
- table for previously signed certs (key-id)

shell-hacks:
- get the ca_sign to function from php..

python
- library for maintaining the database (removing expired data etc).

signing certificates
- log all certificate-requests (!)
- verify all received certificates (compare signed CSR with CSR in database. validate signature,
  and check CA's public key).
- update database with signed CSR, possibly notify user (email, sms..)

- update slcsweb_auth to figure out correct country for user
- update slcs_person to contain country as an element.
