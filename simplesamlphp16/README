===== READ IF YOU ARE USING SIMPLESAMLPHP 1.6.x =====

If you want to use the IdP discovery functionality in Confusa v0.7 along with
simplesamlphp 1.6, it is *necessary* to apply the patch in this directory
on simplesamlphp.

This is because Confusa v0.7 and later, for practical reasons, uses POST to
transfer the scoped IdP list to simplesamlphp's IdP discovery module.
As this is supported only with simplesamlphp 1.7 and later, older versions
need to be patched.
