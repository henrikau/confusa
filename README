Confusa shall provide an easy way of creating an X.509 identity token
from an existing (federated) identity.

It shall do so, by providing a secure login environment for the user, a
way of uploading a singing-request to the Confusa database.

Note: the system *will* check all attributes in the subject of the
CSR and drop the CSR if any of these attributes does not correspond
with attributes obtained from the federated identity.

Current attributes that are checked:
 - key length. Keys shorter than min_key_length in
   config/confusa_config.php will be discarded when the key is
   uploaded.
 - Subject in key. CommonName *must* correspond to
   eduPersonPrincipalName.
 - A certificate will never be reissued. For this reason, Confusa will
   check that the public-key does not belong to a previously signed
   certificate.

The user will then be presented with a list of available (uploaded)
CSRs and the opportunity to inspect, delete or approve for signing.
The latter will either ship the CSR off to the Comodo CA, or to the
internal signing engine (standalone mode).

The signed certificate is then made available to the user, and the
user can choose to download, ship it via email, delete it or revoke it.

This software is provided 'as is', and the developers are, under no
circumstances, responsible for any loss or corruption of data or
hardware you may encounter. It is, however, presented in the most
stable manner possible at this stage, and we work very hard to ensure
that only stable releases reach the public domain.
Please report any bugs to the developers (henrik@austad.us)
