Features of Confusa

- optional login with extra SMS-layer
- custom design of script for creating, uploading and downloading
- key-material (private key, CSR and certificate)
- extensive use of database for storage
- using temporary files to create download capabilities through the
  browser (or via the script).

- sms layer will be removed as this layer does not create any extra
  security corresponding to the extra work the user must do, in order to
