# This is the VERSION-file for Confusa. It is used by the
# (upgrade|update)-scripts to keep track of the files and to juggle the
# upgrades properly.
#
# Therefore:
#
#			DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
#		 (unless you know what you're doing)
#
# You will most likely break the upgrade-scripts, destroying your data,
# sessions, admins, accounts and whatnot.

# If you edit this file, remember: we know where you live, we know your
# grandmother, your inlaws, friends and other relatives. Think those
# pictures from the last company party were awkward? Wait until your
# grandmother gets them on her cell.
#
# So, keep away from this file, eh?
