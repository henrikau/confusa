This folder contains external libraries.

These are *NOT* libraries created by others in use by Confusa.

The files/folders here are tools provided *by* Confusa *for* external users.

All come with the basic assumption: we have done our best to make them
as good as possible, but they may contain errors, so you are using these
on your own peril. Pretty standard GPLvX-clause that.
