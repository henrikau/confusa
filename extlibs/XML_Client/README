This is a short readme.

To use this archive, import the needed files, and play around.

As a start, use XML_Client to download the XML_File from the url,
possibly by passing it along to Confusa_Parser.

A short function will contain somethine like this:


"""
from Confusa_Client import Confusa_Client

cli = Confusa_Client("userkey.pem",
                 "usercert.pem",
                 "https://localhost/ri.php")

res = cli.get_list()
if res:
    print res

"""

This will connect to localhost (assuming Confusa is configured to answer
to the root-section), using userkey and usercert in the current folder
and ask for the list of currently "active users".
