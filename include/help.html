<h3>How do I create a CSR?</h3>

<p>You should consider using the <a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a> toolkit for
the creation of certificate signing requests. OpenSSL comes pre-installed with most
Linux distributions and MacOS X. The OpenSSL project also offers an <a href="http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html">
OpenSSL for Windows</a> download.</p>
<p>Once you have OpenSSL installed on your platform, use it to generate a CSR by typing:</p>
<p class="example">
	openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout userkey.pem -out usercert_request.pem -subj /CN=bla
</p>

<ul class="help">
<li>The generated file <b>userkey.pem</b> is your private key and should during all the
validity time of the certificate be kept by you and <b>only</b> you.</li>
<li>You should
also define a <span class="wtf" title="more than 8 characters, not in the dictionary, include numbers">strong password</span> when asked for it.</li>
<li>The file, which you upload to
Confusa to request a certificate is <b>usercert_request.pem</b>.</li>
</ul>
<b>Note</b>: If Confusa operates in online mode, the subject of the request can
be arbitrary, as shown above, because Confusa will replace it with real values
matching you, once it issues the certificate!
