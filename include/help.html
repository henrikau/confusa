<h3 id="csr_create">How do I create a CSR?</h3>

<p>You should consider using the <a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a> toolkit for
the creation of certificate signing requests. OpenSSL comes pre-installed with most
Linux distributions and MacOS X. The OpenSSL project also offers an <a href="http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html">
OpenSSL for Windows</a> download.</p>
<p>Once you have OpenSSL installed on your platform, use it to generate a CSR by typing:</p>
<p class="example">
	openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout userkey.pem -out usercert_request.pem -subj /CN=bla
</p>

<ul class="help">
<li>The generated file <b>userkey.pem</b> is your private key and should during all the
validity time of the certificate be kept by you and <b>only</b> you.</li>
<li>You should
also define a <span class="wtf" title="more than 8 characters, not in the dictionary, include numbers">strong password</span> when asked for it.</li>
<li>The file, which you upload to
Confusa to request a certificate is <b>usercert_request.pem</b>.</li>
</ul>
<b>Note</b>: If Confusa uses the Comodo-CA, the subject of the request can
be arbitrary, as shown above, because Confusa will replace it with real values
matching you, once it issues the certificate!

<h3 id="export">How to export certificates from the keystore</h3>

<b>Firefox:</b> Go to "Preferences/Advanced/Encryption/View Certificates/Your certificates".
Then press "Backup" on the certificate you want to backup, which will create a PKCS#12 file on your
harddisk. Then follow the steps <a href="#pkcs12">here</a>.<br />
<b>Opera:</b> Go to "Preferences/Advanced/Security/Manage Certificates". Select your certificate and
click "Export". Select PKCS#12 format. If you need the certificate for Grid submission, follow the
steps <a href="#pkcs12">here</a>.<br />
<b>Internet Explorer:</b> Go to "Internet options/Content/Certificates". Click the certificate you
want to export and click "export". When asked, whether to include the private key, confirm the message.
Select PKCS#12 format and "enable strong protection". If you need the certificate for Grid submission, follow the
steps <a href="#pkcs12">here</a>.
<br />
<br />

<h3 id="pkcs12">How to convert between PKCS#12 and X.509</h3>
If you have a PKCS#12 certificate but want it in PEM format (e.g. for Grid job submission), do the following:
<br />
<br />
Private key:
<p class="example">
openssl pkcs12  -nocerts -in cert.p12 -out ~user/.globus/userkey.pem
</p>
<br />
Public key:
<p class="example">
openssl pkcs12 -clcerts  -nokeys -in cert.p12 -out ~user/.globus/usercert.pem
</p>
<br />
Subsequently, give them the right permissions:<br />
<p class="example">
chmod 0600 userkey.pem<br />
chmod 0644 usercert.pem
</p>
