Requirements posed upon the user:

In this document,with user, we mean *you*, the person that downloads,
configures and installs Confusa on a server.

You should have
- some experience with Apache-configuration
- basic knowledge about cryptography (i.e. what a certificate is, and
  how it's used) but not much more is required.
- some, but not excessive, knowledge about PHP and bash-scripting, as
  this will help both *you* and *us* to track down bugs
- an open and positive mind (for a more pleasent interaction with the
  world as a whole). This has nothing to do with Confusa

To install Confusa

1) Install Apache2 with PHP5 support.
2) Install php5-mysql and php5-openssl
3) Install mysql5.
4) Configure Apache to use SSL, use the following lines in your apache2/sites-enabled/appropriate.config.file

<VirtualHost your.host.org:80>
        Servername your.server.org
        Redirect permanent / https://your.host.org
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost your.host.org:443>
        Servername your.server.org
        SSLEngine On
        SSLProtocol All
        SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:!EXPORT40:RC4+RSA:!SSLv2:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+EXP
        SSLVerifyClient optional_no_ca
        SSLVerifyDepth 10
        SSLOptions +StdEnvVars +ExportCertData
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/slcstest.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/slcstest.key

	...
</VirtualHost>

Note that ServerName can be the same as the host-name in VirtualHost.
Make sure you create the folder /etc/apache2/ssl/ as the create-ca.sh
will put hostkeys there for you (a self-signed certificate, you should
get a properly signed certificate for any production-grade instances of
Confusa!).

Alternatively, if you don't want to use this script, put the
key/certificate in the folder of your choice and configure the 2 lines
in the given config-file.

Finally, this is a *sample* configuration. If you know your way around
an Apache configuration, this should be more of a guideline than
anything else. 

5) Install and configure Confusa. This process is somewhat involved as
you will need to configure simpleSAMLphp before you configure
Confusa. Once simpleSAMLphp is configured correctly (with config,
metadata and all that, see http://rnd.feide.no for details) do the
following:

a) Put Confusa in a directory, say /var/www/confusa/

b) Configure Apache with something along the following line:

             Alias /confusa "/var/www/confusa/www/"
             <Directory /var/www/confusa/www>
                        Options Indexes MultiViews
                        AllowOverride None
                        Order allow,deny
                        Allow from all
             </Directory>

   then reload the config ( /etc/init.d/apache2 reload)

   This will enable your host to show the www directory of the
   confusa-folder.


c) Configure the confusa_config.php file (copy the
   confusa_config_template.php and modify that)
   
d) Run the create_database.sh script in confusa/init folder
   This will create the database, the user and the tables. it will use
   the confusa_config.php file, so make sure that this is configured
   properly before you run this script.

e) Add a cron-job of the following type:
   */5 *   * * * /var/www/confusa/programs/clean_db.sh

   This will run the clean_db script every 5 minutes and keep the
   database nice and tidy.

5) Test and verify that the system is operational before you allow the
   public access.
