Requirements posed upon the user:
In this document,with user, we mean *you*, the person that downloads,
configures and installs SLCS-Web on a server.
You should have
- some experience with apache configuration
- knowledge about cryptography (i.e. what a certificate is, and how it's
  used).
- some, but not excessive, knowledge about php and bash-scripting, as
  this will help both *you* and *us* to track down undiscovered bugs
- an open and positive mind (for a more pleasent interaction with the
  world as a whole)

To install SLCS-Web

1) Install php modules and php-mysql
2) Install apache with php support.
3) Configure apache to use SSL, use the following lines in your apache2/sites-enabled/appropriate.config.file

<VirtualHost your.host.org:80>
        Servername your.server.org
        Redirect permanent / https://your.host.org
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost your.host.org:443>
        Servername your.server.org
        SSLEngine On
        SSLProtocol All
        SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:!EXPORT40:RC4+RSA:!SSLv2:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+EXP
        SSLVerifyClient optional_no_ca
        SSLVerifyDepth 10
        SSLOptions +StdEnvVars +ExportCertData
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/slcstest.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/slcstest.key

	...
</VirtualHost>

Note that ServerName can be the same as the host-name in VirtualHost.
Make sure you create the folder /etc/apache2/ssl/ as the create-ca.sh will put hostkeys there for you.
Alternatively, if you don't want to use this script, put the
key/certificate in the folder of your choice and configure the 2 lines
in the given config-file.

4) Install and configure SLCS-Web. The first release will contain
SLCS-Web bundled with simplesamlphp, but this *will* be split up in the
future.

5) Test and verify that the system is operational before you allow the
public access.
